Few things happened :
1. It automatically created new remote Repo under your Github.com account
2. Made the connection with your local repo
3. dded all your commits to remote repo

Now our work will continuew locally

2. commited the change to local repo
3. we want this change to be reflected in remote repository so we pushed local commits to remote repository using psuh origin button
4. observe it has been added in your repository under Github
